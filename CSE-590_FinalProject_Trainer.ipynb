    "In continuation to part 1 of the project, in this revision of the code, all models were trained and tested on three versions of the dataset provided for this project - `Original Dataset`, `Standard Scaled Data` and `MinMax Scaled Data`. Subsequently, in this version of the code, all models were evaluated using the same three versions of the dataset along with `Principal Component Analysis` and `Data Mapping using Clustering`. In all models (except Random Forest classifier which is insenstitive to data normalization), MinMax preprocessing methods improved the performance of the model. Additionally, when PCA and clustering were applied to original datasets, the drop in performance measures of Kernel-SVM, Logistic Regression and MLP classifiers was significant. However, when PCA and clustering was applied on data preprocessed by MinMax Scaler, the drop in performance measures were prevented. Therefore, to examine the correlation between models to pick models for ensemble method, **ONLY** `MinMax Scaled Data` will be compared for each model. Since Random Forest is insensitive to normalization, the correlation of this classifier with others will be based on original data only. "

From the above Mean Square Error results, we see that Random Forest is least correlated with all the remaining models - Kernel-SVM, Logistic Regression and Multi-layered Perceptron. Therefore, three Majority Voting classifiers have been set up - MV1, MV2 and MV3. `MV1 = K-SVM and RF`, `MV2 = Logistic Regression and RF` and `MV3 = MLP and RF`. Since RF is insensitive to data normalization, it was designed to be just the final Random Forest classifier `rf_tree_final`, while the other three models were designed in separate pipelines with MinMaxScaler, since it gave the highest performance accuracy across all 3 models"
